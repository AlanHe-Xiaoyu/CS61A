# CS61A
My version of code for UC Berkeley's CS 61A, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

These include all the code, comments as well as some of the thought process I employed while solving problems and completing projects. I also included all the past exams I've done before midterms, the dicussion/guerilla sections/exam preps and all the solutions.

Feel free to look around and find any resources as they should all be available on HKN (Eta Kappa Nu), TBP (Tau Beta Pi), http://alvinwan.com/cs61a/, and CSM.
